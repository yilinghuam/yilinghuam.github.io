# Eatwat - A restaurant tracking app

## User story
“As a foodie frequenting a multitude of restaurants, I desire an effortless way of recording my ventures, to curate a list of delectable food that I personally savor.”

## Technologies
- **Mapbox** Client side rendering of map, geocoding search and tileset rendering used
- **dotenv** To protect tokens used in mongoDB and Mapbox
- **methodOverride** To allow for patch and delete 
- **partials** Used to make ejs files neater
- **multer with streamifier and cloudinary** for the uploading of single image files using stream

## Experimented 
- **cloudinary with express-file-upload**
- wireframing using **justinmind**

## Approach
* read up on documentation for mapbox and geocoding search and testing of mapbox functions
* wireframing
* setting up database structure
* set up mvc structure with crud routes
* add form information into database
* testing of upload function with multer and cloudinary
* build mapsearch pages
* build routes to edit database form information

## Unsolved
* slight delay in terms or uploading photos. Tried using streams but did not fix the time delay involved.
* fontawesome in dropdown options not showing

## Possible Improvements
* include uploading of image via url
* prevent one and two star ratings restaurant from appearing in random

-----------------------------------------
notes to yourself 
- add border to active link in nav bar
- add validation for form
- add titles for edit and new form to segregate
- add log in log out feature
- clean up image uploading codes
- consider add lazy loading codes
