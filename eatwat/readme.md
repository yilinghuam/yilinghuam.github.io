# Eatwat - A restaurant tracking app

## Explanations of the technologies used
- Mapbox
Client side rendering of map. geocoding and tileset rendering used
- dotenv
To protect tokens used in mongoDB and Mapbox
- methodOverride
To allow for patch and delete 
- partials
To make ejs files neater
- cloudinary with express-fileupload

or 
multer with streamifier and cloudinary 
- 
## Approach taken
### 1. Initial start
- decide on the unknown factor of the project, the map api to be used
- read the documentation for the mapbox api and implement some functionalities gradually (at this point, only loading of the map and geosearching api)
- think of how to post the geosearching results to the backend

### 2. Creation of routes
- Create routes based on 7 restful routes
- adjust data as I go along
